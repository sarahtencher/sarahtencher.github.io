	        <p id="ok">
				This summer, I had the opportunity to work on the UX/UI team at vArmour, an innovative cloud security startup. During my time there, I worked on settings pages and First Time User experiences for new product features, created research prototypes, conducted user tests and synthesized research results, and created a large scale Pattern Library to help maintain consistency between UX designs and UI implementations.

				My time at vArmour taught me about designing enterprise technology and the fast-paced start-up atmoshpere. I was able to work with and learn from inspiring and talented designers and engineers and could not be more grateful for such an incredible experience. Most of my work cannot be shared, but the Creative Director I worked beneath would be more than happy to recommend me and my work!
