	        <p id="ok">
				This summer, I had the opportunity to work on the UX/UI team at vArmour, an innovative cloud security startup. During my time there, I worked on settings pages and First Time User experiences for [sellers on tablet], created research prototypes, conducted user tests and synthesized research results, and created a large scale Pattern Library to bridge the gap between the UX and UI and enforce consistency in UX designs and UI implementations.

				My time at vArmour taught me a lot about designing enterprise technology and the fast-paced start-up atmoshpere. I was able to work with and learn from inspiring and talented designers and engineers and could not be more grateful for such an incredible experience. Most of my work is cannot be shared, but the Creative Director would be more than happy to recommend me and my work!
