                    In an effort to better educate visitors, increase engagement and drive 
                    leads I redesigned parts of the Rehearsal corporate website utilizing 
                    web design trends and best practices.

                <p>
                    Since rehearsal is a web app that can apply to many different use cases, 
                    it is not always immediately clear how the product can apply to every 
                    individual visitor. I aimed to solve this problem by more clearly spelling 
                    out our most common use cases under the main hero using both icons and text. 
                    I hope that the icons will catch the users attention and the short text 
                    snippets will keep their attention while quickly helping them understand 
                    what Rehearsal can help them with.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    According to our analytics, the most clicked case study was only clicked 
                    0.6% of the time. Since these studies are so important in driving leads 
                    it is imperative that visitors notice and engage with them. By using faces, 
                    which psychology shows draws attention, and other more interesting graphics 
                    I aim to increase the case study click rate. I applied this same strategy and 
                    design to the video and case studies pages and am excited to see the results 
                    there as well.

                <p>
                    As I scrolled down the home page, I felt that I was left with no action once I 
                    reached the end. I wanted to provide another opportunity for users to fill out 
                    an interest form so I designed a series of seven footers with one main call to 
                    action to place at the end of the home page. Even if just one user clicks this 
                    call to action, it is one more chance at a lead and possible sale for the company.
