                    In an effort to better educate visitors, increase engagement and drive leads I redesigned parts of
                    the Rehearsal coorporate website utilizing web design trends and best practices.

                    In an effort to better educate visitors, increase engagement and drive leads I redesigned parts of
                    the Rehearsal coorporate website utilizing web design trends and best practices. Since rehearsal is a
                    web app that can apply to many different use cases, it is not always immediately clear how the product can
                    apply to every individual visitor. I aimed to solve this problem by more clearly spelling out our most common
                    use cases under the main hero using both icons and text. I hope that the icons will catch the users attention and
                    the short text snippets will keep thier attention while quickly helping them undetstand what Rehearsal can help them
                    with.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Case Studies</h2>

                <p>
                    According to our analytics, the most clicked case study was only clicked 0.6% of the time. Since these studies
                    are so important in driving leads it is imperative that visitors notice and engage with them. By using faces, which psychology
                    shows draws attention, and other more interesting graphics I aim to increase the case study click rate. I applied
                    this same strategy and design to the video and case studies pages and am excited to see the results there as well.

                <h2>Call to Action Footers</h2>

                <p>
                    As I scrolled down the home page, I felt that I was left with no action once I reached the end. I wanted to provide another
                     opportunity for users to fill out an interest form so I designed a series of seven footers with one main call to action to
                     place at the end of the home page. Even if just one user clicks this call to action, it is one more chance at a lead and
                     possible sale for the company.
                 </p>
