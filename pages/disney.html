                    <p>
                        As a designer on Disney Entertainment & ESPN Technology's Enterprise Design Team I directly contribute to business goals by creating designs that break down complex problems into usable interfaces, allowing users
                        to do their jobs more easily, efficiently, and confidently. This includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="disneylist">
                        <li>
                            completing extensive discovery, lay the foundations for complex redesigned enterprise tools, and deliver low- to high-fidelity designs
                            validated and tested with users, all while proving the strength and value of UX and our processes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            reducing time to market for new features by focusing on scalable and repeatable design patterns
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            managing several nuanced project engagements and relationships simultaneously and negotiate for time, innovate where
                            appropriate, and discuss trade-offs in how to deliver
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            working closely with developers to understand their limitations and iterate designs to better fit business timelines and development
                            constraints without losing sight of user needs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            creating high-fidelity, fully interactive prototypes to support qualitative and quantitative user research and testing efforts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            collaborating with internal teams to define a new visual language and design system to span the entire enterprise suite of
                            applications (over 800)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
