                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    In the past, Understand has licensed medical animation libraries and interactive
                    deep dives to medical professionals around the world. When Understand decided
                    to add single animations and images to the product offering as well, they needed a
                    new site and webstore.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    As an animation and illustration company, Understand has a lot of visual content to
                    proudly showcase therefore the goals of the redesign were:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimalistic, simple design with neutral colors and space between elements</li>
                        <li>Show breadth of products in a way that is not overwhelming and is easy to consume</li>
                        <li>Get users to product of interest quickly</li>
                        <li>Increased ease of use and better overall user experience</li>
                        <li>Smooth checkout so as not to hinder sales</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted the process of finding an asset and purchasing it to be as seamless as
                    possible. To facilitate this, there is a large focal search bar on the home page
                    for users who know exactly what they are looking for. This prominent search
                    is the most efficient and effective way to allow users easy access to the broad product
                    catalog. Below are sections that encourage exploration for users who find themselves on the site
                    without an exact goal in mind.
                </p>

                <!-- [Home Page] -->
                <div class="images">
                    <div class="image" style="max-width: 50%;">
                        <img src="../assets/images/understand-site/ipad_home.png" />
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The checkout process is an incredibly important part of the users experience and it was imperative
                    to me that the checkout experience is as painless as possible. A status indicator is placed at the
                    top of each step so users know exactly where they are, what they have done, and what they have left
                    to do. The order details are also displayed at every step so that users are not forced to leave the
                    checkout to double check their carts and can proceed without questions. Finally, a review tab is
                    included in the process so users can ensure all of their personal details and items to be purchased
                    are correct before submitting their payment details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This site is not only a store, but also describes who Understand is as a company. Making sure
                    these supplemental pages matched the style of the store was important to maintain users' trust.
                    Users can learn about Understand and what makes them a credible place to satisfy any
                    medical animation and imagery needs.
                </p>

                    My personal favorite part of the site is the product dropdown menu. It serves to categorize
                    the most important products and provide access to all products offered in the store. When Understand
                    partnered with Blausen, this menu had to be redesigned to accomodate all of Understand's
                    new product offerings. I found it so difficult to design away from something I loved so
                    much, and in the end I loved the new version just as much (if not more) than the previous
                    version.

                    When users reach the site what they see is a highly customized shopify theme as well as custom
                    react apps for search and checkout. I wrote most of the html, css, javascript, and react code and I
                    could not be prouder or more thrilled.

                <h2>Post Launch Testing and Pain Points</h2>
                <p>
                    After studying user interactions and running usability tests, it was clear that users are not
                    scrolling enough. On product pages specifically, users are scrolling less than 40% of the time. User
                    testing concluded that users do not realize that there is more on the page than just the top section
                    introducing the product. Data also showed that people were not interacting with the product demo
                    nearly as much as expected. I took this information and decided to run some A/B tests focusing on
                    how to encourage scrolling and increase interaction with the animation player.
                </p>

                <p>
                    30% of users shown version A scrolled and 30% clicked into the product demo while 100% of users
                    shown version B scrolled and 66% clicked into the product demo. Overall, version B was
                    most sucessful in achieving our outlined goals. My next steps will be to run a similar test with a
                    more respresentative group of users, including doctors, medical staff, and medical students, to
                    gather more conclusive evidence.
