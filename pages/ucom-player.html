                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand sells 3D medical animations on a subscription basis to customers around the world. These
                    customers embed the Understand player into their websites via iFrame for patients to view and become
                    better educated about the medical procedures offered. Currently, only 22% of users interact with the
                    player, and most of this interaction consists of playing and pausing the video they are watching. I
                    redesign the Understand Player with two main goals in mind: give it a more modern look and feel and
                    increase user interaction.
                </p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Previously, the animation menu was heavily text-based, with videos hidden behind menu categories.
                    The new player exposes videos more clearly and draws attention with graphics and large headings, as
                    well as details about video views and likes. With a clear tab menu design, now there is more space
                    for videos, ideally encouraging users to explore animation categories and videos more. The second
                    main improvement was removing unused features and redesigning the most used features to be more
                    accessible and user friendly. Features such as the ability to share and like videos have come to be
                    expected in modern media players and were therefore added to the new player.

                <p>
                    After the design was complete, I created a fully functional prototype with HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. After this step, I usually hand the designs and prototype to the front-end developers
                    and aid them with any questions. For the first time, I was allowed to test my React skills and put
                    them to use. I made all of the components for both the desktop and mobile versions of the menu and
                    player. Developing the player was not only such a great learning experience, but I also felt so
                    proud to take my designs farther than I ever had before.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was redesigning the seek bar to include both steps and doctor's notes. Each
                    video is broken up into logical chunks called steps which were previously displayed as a list to the
                    side of each playing video. Analytics showed that only 1.5% of viewers clicked on these steps. In
                    the redesign, I displayed the steps as notches in the seek bar as a way to save space as well as
                    give them a contextually logical location. When users hover over the notches, tooltips appear
                    displaying relevant step information and the ability to seek to this part of the video. Doctors also
                    have the opportunity to attach a doctor's note to each step. This is a legacy feature that needed to
                    be supported, despite its small current use. I designed the notes as large popovers that appear
                    above the current step notch as the video enters each step. One note is shown at a time and is shown
                    until the user takes an action to close it. Current use trends show that users rarely re-open the
                    doctor's notes after actively closing them, therefore in the redesign, after actively closing the
                    note the user has to rewind the video and enter the step again to trigger the note to reopen. This
                    decision was made in an attempt to save space and increase usability.
                </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The doctor's notes did not become less of a challenge after the design phase was complete.
                    Implementing these notes in React also proved to be a new and interesting challenge. Since these
                    doctor's notes are fairly large and are placed based on the location of each step, some of the notes
                    bled outside of the visible part of the player. To determine when to restyle these overflowing
                    notes, I had to calculate each note's location and size and if it was in the viewport. When React
                    renders a view, it starts by rendering the children and then each child's parents. Since I was
                    trying to determine the parent's coordinates to render its children, I was running into a lot of
                    errors. The solution was using ref's and accessing the DOM directly. Since this was my first React
                    project, I ran into many similar challenges, each of which teaching me more about programming in
                    React. After completing this project I feel much more comfortable with this development framework
                    and am looking forward to the next time I can use it.

                <p>
                    I am beyond excited for this new player and menu to go live and be viewed by millions of patients
                    and doctors each year. Just as we have been, we will continue to collect user interaction data and
                    compare it with previous data to determine which design decisions were successful and which ones
                    were not. While another re-design soon is unlikely, I am looking forward to synthesizing the data we
                    receive to encouraging further improvements to the media player.
