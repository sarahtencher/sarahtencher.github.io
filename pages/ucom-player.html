                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand sells 3D medical animations on a subscription basis to customers around the world. These
                    customers embed the Understand player into their websites via iFrame for patients to view and become
                    better educated about the medical procedures offered. Currently, only 22% of users interact with the player
                    and most of this interaction consists of simply playing and pausing the video they are watching.
                    The Understand Player was redesigned with 2 main goals in mind: give it a more modern look and feel
                    and increase user interaction.
                </p>

                    <img src="../assets/images/ucom-menu-before.png"/>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Previously, the animation menu was heavily text based with videos hidden behind
                    menu catagories. The new player exposes videos more clearly and draws attention with
                    graphics and large headings, as well as details about video views and likes. With a clear
                    tab menu design there is now more space for videos, ideally encouraging users to explore
                    animation categories and videos more.

                    The second main improvement was removing unused features and redesigning the most used features
                    to be more accesible and user friendly. Features such as the ability to share and like videos have
                    come to be expected in modern media players and were therefore added to the new player.

                <p>
                    After the design was complete, I created a fully functional prototype with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Usually
                    after this step, I hand the designs and prototype to the front-end developers and aid them with any questions they
                    may have. For the first time, I was given the opportunity to test my React skills and really put them to use. While the
                    main structure and data gathering for the app was done by the development lead, I made all of the components for both
                    the desktop and mobile versions of the menu and player. This was not only such a great learning experience, but I also
                    felt so proud to take my designs farther than I ever had before.

                </div>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was redesigning the seekbar to include both steps and doctors notes. Each video
                    is broken up into logical chunks called steps which were previously displayed as a list to the
                    side of each playing video. Analytics showed that only 1.5% of viewers actually clicked on these steps.
                    In the redesign, I displayed the steps as notches in the seekbar as a way to save space as well as give them
                    a contextually logical location. When users hover over the notches, tooltips appears displaying relevant step
                    information and the ability to seek to this part of the video. Doctors also have the opportunity to attach a
                    doctor's note to each step. This is a legacy feature that needed to be supported, despite its small current
                    utility. I designed the notes as large popovers that appear above the current step notch as the video enters
                    each step. One note is shown at a time and is shown until the user takes an action close it. Current use trends
                    show that users rarely re-open the doctor's notes after actively closing them, therefore in the redesign, after
                    actively closing the note the user has to rewind the video and enter the step again to view the note again. This
                    decsion was made in an attempt to save space and increase usability.

                    The doctor's notes did not become less of a challenge after the design was complete. Implementing these notes in React
                    also proved to be a new and interesting challenge. Since these doctor's notes are fairly large and are placed based on
                    the location of each step, some of the notes bled outside of the visible part of the player. To determine when to restyle
                    these overflowing notes, I had to calculate each notes location and size and whether or not it was in the viewport. When
                    React renders a view, it starts by rendering the children and then each childs parents. Since I was trying to determine the
                    parents coordinates in order to render its children I was running into a lot of errors. The solution was using ref's and
                    accessing the DOM - ...

                <p>
                    I am beyond excited for this new player and menu to go live and be viewed by millions of patients and doctors each year. Just
                    as we have been, we will continue to collect user inteaction data and compare it with previous data to determine which design
                    decisions were successful and which ones were not. While another re-design in the near future is unlikely, I am looking forward
                    to synthesizing the data we recieve to encouraging further improvements to the media player.
