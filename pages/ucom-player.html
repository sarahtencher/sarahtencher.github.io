                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand sells 3D medical animations on a subscription basis to 
                    customers around the world. These customers embed the Understand 
                    player into their websites via iFrame for patients to view and 
                    become better educated about the medical procedures offered. 
                    Currently, only 22% of users interact with the player and most of 
                    this interaction consists of simply playing and pausing the video 
                    they are watching. The Understand Player was redesigned with 2 main 
                    goals in mind: give it a more modern look and feel and increase user 
                    interaction.
                </p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Previously, the animation menu was heavily text based with videos 
                    hidden behind menu categories. The new player exposes videos more 
                    clearly and draws attention with graphics and large headings, as well 
                    as details about video views and likes. With a clear tab menu design 
                    there is now more space for videos, ideally encouraging users to 
                    explore animation categories and videos more. The second main 
                    improvement was removing unused features and redesigning the most used 
                    features to be more accessible and user friendly. Features such as the 
                    ability to share and like videos have come to be expected in modern 
                    media players and were therefore added to the new player.

                <p>
                    After the design was complete, I created a fully functional prototype 
                    with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Usually after this step, I hand the 
                    designs and prototype to the front-end developers and aid them with 
                    any questions they may have. For the first time, I was given the 
                    opportunity to test my React skills and really put them to use. While 
                    the main structure and data gathering for the app was done by the 
                    development lead, I made all of the components for both the desktop 
                    and mobile versions of the menu and player. This was not only such a 
                    great learning experience, but I also felt so proud to take my designs 
                    farther than I ever had before.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was redesigning the seekbar to include both steps and 
                    doctors notes. Each video is broken up into logical chunks called steps which 
                    were previously displayed as a list to the side of each playing video. Analytics 
                    showed that only 1.5% of viewers actually clicked on these steps. In the redesign, 
                    I displayed the steps as notches in the seekbar as a way to save space as well as 
                    give them a contextually logical location. When users hover over the notches, 
                    tooltips appear displaying relevant step information and the ability to seek to 
                    this part of the video. Doctors also have the opportunity to attach a doctor's note 
                    to each step. This is a legacy feature that needed to be supported, despite its small 
                    current use. I designed the notes as large popovers that appear above the current 
                    step notch as the video enters each step. One note is shown at a time and is shown 
                    until the user takes an action close it. Current use trends show that users rarely 
                    re-open the doctor's notes after actively closing them, therefore in the redesign, 
                    after actively closing the note the user has to rewind the video and enter the step 
                    again trigger the note to reopen. This decision was made in an attempt to save space 
                    and increase usability.

                </div>

                <p>
                    The doctor's notes did not become less of a challenge after the design phase was 
                    complete. Implementing these notes in React also proved to be a new and interesting 
                    challenge. Since these doctor's notes are fairly large and are placed based on the 
                    location of each step, some of the notes bled outside of the visible part of the 
                    player. To determine when to restyle these overflowing notes, I had to calculate 
                    each notes location and size and whether or not it was in the viewport. When React 
                    renders a view, it starts by rendering the children and then each child's parents. 
                    Since I was trying to determine the parents coordinates in order to render its 
                    children I was running into a lot of errors. The solution was using ref's and 
                    accessing the DOM directly. Since this was my first React project, I ran into many 
                    similar challenges, each of which teaching me more about programming in React. After 
                    completing this project I feel much more comfortable with this development framework 
                    and am looking forward to the next time I am able to use it.

                <p>
                    I am beyond excited for this new player and menu to go live and be viewed by 
                    millions of patients and doctors each year. Just as we have been, we will 
                    continue to collect user interaction data and compare it with previous data to 
                    determine which design decisions were successful and which ones were not. While 
                    another re-design in the near future is unlikely, I am looking forward to 
                    synthesizing the data we receive to encouraging further improvements to the media 
                    player. </p>
