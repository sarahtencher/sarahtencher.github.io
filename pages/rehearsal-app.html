                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest contribution to the rehearsal application is my redesign of the administrative conversation thread.
                    This view is arguably the most important view of the administrative product and I was beyond excited to be
                    given such an important task.
                    Rehearsal is a tool facilitating asynchronous conversations between mentors and learners. The admin conversation thread
                    is the where mentors go to view learner responses and leave feedback and grades. The nature
                    of this task makes it very tedious, as each mentor has multiple learners responding to each scenario
                    in a very similar way. One main goal was to make this task as painless as possible. By implementing shortcuts such as easy
                    and intuitive navigation between learner responses, I aimed to reduce the friction involved in watching and
                    responding to multiple responses.

                <p>
                    One main improvement to the admin thread is the sticky top bar. Since these conversation threads are long and
                    relatively similar to each other, it is important that the mentor is aware of who is responding to what scenario.
                    By displaying this data concisely and keeping it in the users view at all times instead of at the top of the page
                    as it is currently, we are ensuring the mentor never looses track of the current conversation and is able to
                    maintain an uninterrupted  workflow. Additionally this top bar displays the conversations status and a recommended
                    action to help the mentor progress the conversation in a meaningful way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One issue with the current conversation thread is that users will type their feedback but forget to publish it.
                    By using a bright bold color for the publish button and an additional warning message, users should be more aware
                    of their current publication status and the steps to take to publish their responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mentors have two options when leaving any kind of feedback to a response: typing a response or recording a response.
                    In the previous conversation thread, both types of response options were displayed inline, giving them equal value. Since
                    the entire app encourages video responses, we want mentors to respond with videos as well. To encourage this, the recording
                    option is displayed above the typing option in the new design.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    In the original design there was a significant amount of confusion surrounding the difference
                    between Comments, Prompts, and
                    Feedback. Comments are a way to leave informal feedback that does not progress the
                    conversation. Prompts require the learner to record another response and continue
                    the conversation, and feedback is the official conclusion of the conversation allowing
                    the mentor to review the learners responses and submit a final score. While commenting
                    is and action tied to an individual responses and prompting and leaving feedback are tied
                    to the conversation thread as a whole, I decided display them in the same way in the same location
                    to better juxtapose their purposes and intended uses. Since commenting is the least
                    encouraged response it is placed last, hopefully encouraging mentors to prompt and
                    leave feedback for the their learners.

                <p>
                    After completing the UX and Visual Designs, I created a fully functional prototype with
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In order to avoid design degradation as much as possible,
                    I take my prototypes as far as I can, showing every possible state as well as every
                    animation and interaction. I then passed the prototype on to the front end developers
                    who converted the prototype to React while preserving as much detail as they can.

                    Since this part of the application is so important, we will continue to receive
                    feedback to use in future iterations. This part of the app has been a pain point
                    for many users and I hope that the redesign addresses many of the issues users were facing.
                    Additionally, I hope to design a first time user onboarding experience to help users quickly
                    become more comfortable with the platform.
