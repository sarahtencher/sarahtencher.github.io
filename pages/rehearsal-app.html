                <p>
                    My biggest contribution to the rehearsal application is my redesign of the administrative conversation thread.
                    This view is arguably the most important view of the administrative product and I was beyond excited to be
                    given such an important task.
                    Rehearsal is a tool facilitating asychnronous conversations between mentors and learners. The admin conversation thread
                    is the where mentors go to view learner responses and leave feedback and grades. The nature
                    of this task makes it very tedious, as each mentor has multiple learners responding to each scenario
                    in a very similar way. One main goal was to make this task as painless as possible. By implementing shortcuts such as easy
                    and intuitive navigation between learner responses, I aimed to reduce the friction involved in watching and
                    responding to multiple responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One main improvement to the admin thread is the sticky top bar. Since these threads are long and relatively similar to eachother,
                    it is important that the mentor is aware of who is responding to what scenario. By displaying this data concisely and keeping it in the
                    users view at all times instead of at the top of the page as it is currently, we are ensuring the mentor never looses
                    track of the current conversation and is able to maintain an uninterupted workflow.

                </div>

                <p>
                    One issue with the current thread is that users will type thier feedback but forget to press submit. By using a bright bold color
                    for the submit button and an additional warning message, users should be more aware of thier current publication status.

                    In the previous thread, record and type options were displayed inline. In the redesign, they are stacked with video on top, encouraging
                    video feedback from mentors. The entire product is heavily video based, therefore we want to encourage mentors to respond
                    with video, just as their learners are.

                <p>
                    In the original design there was a lot of confusion about Comments, Prompts and Feedback. Comment ... while prompts ... and feedback ...
                    While commenting is and action tied to an individual response and prompting and feedbacking are tied to the thread in general, I decided
                    display them in the same way in the same location to better juxtapose thier purposes and indended uses. Since commenting is the least
                    encouraged response it is placed last, hopfully encouraging prompting and leaving feedback first.

                    conversation status and reccomended action since these threads can be overwhelming, especially to a new user.

                    MORE! Design decisions, legacy, what did you change, who the f cares.

                <p>
                    After completing the UX and Visual Designs, I created a fully functional prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    In order to avoid design degredation as much as possible, I take my prototypes as far as possible, showing every possible
                    state as well as every animation and interaction. I then passed the prototype on to the front end developers who convert the prototype
                    to React while preserving as much detail as they can.

                    Since this is such an important and 'action packed' part of the app, I think that an onboarding tutorial specifically for mentor
                    responses should be designed and developed.
